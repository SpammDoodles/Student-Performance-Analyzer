## 🛠 Features

* Load student data from CSV
* Analyze individual and overall performance
* Generate summaries and statistics
* Identify top-performing and underperforming students
* (Optional) Could be extended to visualize data with graphs

## 💻 Usage

1. Make sure Python 3.x is installed.
2. Place `students.csv` in the same directory as `student_analyzer.py`.
3. Run the analyzer:

```bash
python student_analyzer.py
```

4. Follow prompts or view results in the console.

## 🔧 Dependencies

* Python 3.x
* (Optional) `pandas` for advanced data handling
* (Optional) `matplotlib` or `seaborn` for visualization

Install dependencies using:

## 🗑️ Notes

* Ensure the CSV file follows the correct format (headers, grades, etc.).
* Currently, the analyzer works with the sample dataset `students.csv`.

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Add graphical visualization of grades
* Implement filtering and search for specific students
* Support multiple input formats (Excel, JSON, etc.)
* Export analysis results to a report (PDF/CSV)
